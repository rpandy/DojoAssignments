/*Array: Reverse
Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place.
The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed.
Working ‘in-place’ means that you cannot use a second array – move values within the array that you are given.
As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().*/
