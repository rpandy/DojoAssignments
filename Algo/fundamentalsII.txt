Short Answer Questions: Fundamentals II
What is the JavaScript Math library? What does is contain?
The JavaScript Math Library is a related set of functions and values that have been grouped together under a common name. it contains Math.Pi(), Math.floor(), Math.ceil(), Math.random() and Math.trunc().

Why aren't all those functions just included in JavaScript Automatically?
Theyâ€™re excluded for a minimized version of the language. Intended for possible future uses where memory is an issue.

If I call Math.random(), what will it return?
this will return a decimal number between 0 and 1.

What do the following functions do: Math.floor, Math.ceil, Math.trunc, Math.round?
Math.floor() makes negative numbers more negative and positive numbers less positive. Decreases values

Math.ceil() makes positives more positive and negatives less negative. Increases values

Math.trunc() drops any fraction, moving the number towards 0.

Math.round() will round a figure to the next integer up.

When do Math.floor and Math.trunc not return the same value?
when the number is negative.

What is the % operator and when is it useful?
modulo is useful to traverse through digits, splice a particular digit off of a longer number, find the remainder of 2 divided values, to determine whether or not a figure is even or odd or to determine what the figure is divisible by. 

How do I make variables declared outside (right next to) a function visible inside it?
You should contain variables within a function when possible, but you can declare them outside if needed.


Why should I comment my code? Isn't commenting just a waste of time?
You should comment your code because it helps you to remember the logic that you followed when you originally wrote it. It makes the code more readable and it also helps when others try to look through your code. Its good industry practice and it makes your code more of a pleasure to work with.
