Python Checklist:
import necessary dependencies from flask (Flask, request, redirect, render_template, session, flash

import MySQLConnector to connect to SQL

import Bcrypt for encryption 

bcrypt = Bcrpty(app)
app = Flask(__name__)

include MySQLConnector file in project directory

import re for validation

app.secret_key = “YOU PICK THE NAME”

copy EMAIL REGEX to avoid errors

Don’t forget decorator (@) before every route

routes in quotes - @app.route(‘/’)

if mysqlconnection.pyc file does not appear in your project folder then the sql connection didnt work


makes sure that you do not ask for information that you did not send from the server side. This will cause an error because we don’t know what to look for.

make sure there is no semi-colon at the end of your SQL statement in Python

make sure there are commas in between key value pairs in Data dictionary before plugging them into mysql.query_db.

“Bad Request The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.” means that we’re sending over information from the form that the server cannot find.

watch for spelling of bcrypt!!
